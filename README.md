## 3. How can you gauge the existing knowledge of your audience to avoid overwhelming them with jargon?
- Conduct surveys or feedback forms before presenting content.
- Observe past interactions or questions to assess knowledge gaps.
- Offer different content levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced).

## 4. What techniques can you use to ensure your content is accessible to those with limited technical knowledge?
- Use simple, everyday language instead of complex terminology.
- Break down information into step-by-step instructions.
- Provide examples, visuals, and tooltips for clarity.

## 5. Why is it important to use plain language instead of technical jargon in your writing?
